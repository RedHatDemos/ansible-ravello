= Tutorial 01

== Prerequisites

The following dependencies must be installed:

- Python >= 2.7
- Ravello Python Sdk (`ravello-sdk` from `pip`)
- Ansible >=2.3

Credentials for a ravello subscription must be stored in 
`~/.ravello_login`.  This repository provides a utility
for setting and encrypting credentials.  

From the top-level directory of this repository, execute:

```
./tools/set-creds
```

A useable virtual disk image of Red Hat Enterprise Linux in your Ravello 
disk images library.  We will use an image called
`rhel-guest-image-7.3-35.x86_64`.

== Set Your Current Working Directory

In order for Ansible to see the provided modules and roles, 
`ansible-playbook` should always be called from the top 
directory of the ansible-ravello repository.

```
cd <path/to>/ansible-ravello
```

== Create a Dynamic Inventory

This repository provides the core of a dynamic inventory script at 
`ravello-ansible/inventory/ravello.py`.  The `ravello.py`
script requires the name of the provisioned Ravello app to be passed
as an extra argument.  Since Ansible can not pass extra arguments to the
dynamic inventory, it is necessary create an app-specific inventory script to
act as a wrapper around `ravello.py`.  

This repository provides a utility for creating app-specific dynamic inventories.

From the top-level directory of `ansible-ravello`, execute the command:

```
./tools/create-inventory my.first.app -o ./inventory
```

You will use this newly created inventory any time you run `ansible-playbook`.

== Create the Playbook

In the top level directory of the `ansible-ravello` repo, create 
a new file called `my-first-app.yml`.  This playbook file will 
do the following things:

* Set the application name using the variable `application_name`
* Set up the instances which will be created
* Call the `ravello-provision-app` role
* Set the login message on the instances

```
---
# my-first-app.yml

- name: provision my first application
  hosts: localhost
  vars:
   # This variable is used by the ravello-provision-app role
   # to determine the application name
    - application_name: my.first.app
   # The `instances` dictionary tells the ravello-provision-app
   # role how to provision VMs
    - instances:
      - name: bastion
        services:
          - protocol: ssh
            port: 22
      - name: server
        proxy: bastion
  tasks:
   # This role provisions a new application in ravello
    - include_role:
        name: ravello-provision-app

- name: set login message on instances
  become: true
  hosts:
    - bastion
    - server
  tasks:
    - copy:
        content: "Welcome to {{ inventory_hostname }}!\n"
        dest: /etc/motd
  
```

== Deploying the Application

You are now ready to deploy your first Ravello application with Ansible.  
Run `ansible-playbook` from the top-level directory of the `ansible-ravello`
repository to build and launch your application.

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory my-first-app.yml -vv
```

Ansible will begin provisioning your application in Ravello.
It will take a few moments before the application is ready.

== Accessing Your Deployed Environment

If Ansible succeeds, then congratulations, your first app is ready!

If you check the applications list in your account on the Ravello web UI,
you will see a new app called `my.first.app`.  It will contain 
two instances as follows:

* `bastion` - externally facing
* `server`  - internal to application subnet

The `bastion` instance will be resolvable over via the public web, but
the `server` instance is private.  Traffic to `server` must be routed 
through the bastion.

At this point, your application should be accessible via ssh, but no 
passwords have been set yet.  The final step in this introductory tutorial
is to set passwords on your application instances via ssh.  In future tutorials 
we will automate password setup, but for new we will set passwords manually. 

As part of the application provisioning process, the `ravello-provision-app`
role will have generated an application work directory located at 
`ansible-ravello/workdir/`.  Within that work directory will be an 
ssh keypair you can use to access your new app.

To find the public hostname of the bastion instance, you can use the Ravello 
web UI or execute the following command:

```
./inventory --proxy-fqdns
```

To access the bastion, execute the following ssh command
replacing <bastion-public-fqdn> with the public hostname of the 
`bastion` instance:

```
user@localhost $ ssh -i workdir/my.first.app.id_rsa cloud-user@<bastion-public-fqdn>

= Set password on bastion
cloud-user@bastion $ sudo su -c "passwd"

= ssh to server from bastion
cloud-user@bastion $ ssh server

= Set password on server
cloud-user@server $ sudo su -c "passwd"
```

You should now be able to access your instances through 
the console in the Ravello web UI.

== Next Steps

The next tutorial covers how to configure the number of virtual machine 
instances and their virtual hardware configurations in the 
`ravello-provision-app` role.
