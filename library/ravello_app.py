notes:
  - C(app_template) and C(blueprint) are mututally exclusive. One of which is required when C(state) is present or started where creation of a Ravello application may need to occur.
  - Publishing preferences, C(preferred_cloud), C(preferred_region) and C(optimization_level), are only considered when initially published. Using different values will not change the publishing state of the Ravello application.
